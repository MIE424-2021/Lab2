    "In this lab, you will be using linear classifier to build a spam classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many email services today provide spam filters that are able to classify emails into spam and non-spam email with high accuracy. You will use linear classifier to build your own spam filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be training a classifier to classify whether a given email, $x$, is spam ($y = 1$) or non-spam ($y = 0$). In particular, you need to convert each email into a feature vector $x \\in R^n$. The following parts of the lab will walk you through how such a feature vector can be constructed from an email.\n",

    "The dataset has been processed using the following feature extraction. n = # words in vocabulary list. Specifically, the feature $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ for an email corresponds to whether the $i$-th word in the dictionary occurs in the email. That is, $x_i = 1$ if the $i$-th word is in the email and $x_i$ = 0 if the $i$-th word is not present in the email.\n"

    "Preprocessing process:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Lower-casing: The entire email is converted into lower case, so that captialization is ignored (e.g., IndIcaTE is treated the same as Indicate).\n",
    "- Stripping HTML: All HTML tags are removed from the emails. Many emails often come with HTML formatting; we remove all the HTML tags, so that only the content remains.\n",
    "- Normalizing URLs: All URLs are replaced with the text “httpaddr”.\n",
    "- Normalizing Email Addresses: All email addresses are replaced with the text “emailaddr”.\n",
    "- Normalizing Numbers: All numbers are replaced with the text “number”.\n",
    "- Normalizing Dollars: All dollar signs are replaced with the text “dollar”.\n",
    "- Word Stemming: Words are reduced to their stemmed form. For ex- ample, “discount”, “discounts”, “discounted” and “discounting” are all replaced with “discount”. Sometimes, the Stemmer actually strips off additional characters from the end, so “include”, “includes”, “included”, and “including” are all replaced with “includ”.\n",
    "- Removal of non-words: Non-words and punctuation have been re- moved. All white spaces (tabs, newlines, spaces) have all been trimmed to a single space character.\n",
    "\n",
    "After preprocessing the emails, we have a list of words for each email. The next step is to choose which words we would like to use in our classifier and which we would want to leave out.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we have chosen only the most frequently occuring words as our set of words considered (the vocabulary list). Since words that occur rarely in the training set are only in a few emails, they might cause the model to overfit our training set. The complete vocabulary list is in the file vocab.txt and also shown in the figure below. Our vocabulary list was selected by choosing all words which occur at least a 100 times in the spam corpus, resulting in a list of 1899 words. In practice, a vocabulary list with about 10,000 to 50,000 words is often used.\n"
